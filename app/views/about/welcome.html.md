Let's talk about authentication. I know, I know&mdash;you'd rather not. But you want to hear this. I promise.

Authentication isn't actually a bad thing. It's just that we haven't found an elegant solution to it.

Yet.

Think about how many passwords you have? Now, think about how many you forgot. _That_'s the feeling of password fatigue[<svg fill="none" viewBox="0 0 24 24" stroke="currentColor"><path stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" stroke-width="2" d="M10 6H6a2 2 0 00-2 2v10a2 2 0 002 2h10a2 2 0 002-2v-4M14 4h6m0 0v6m0-6L10 14"/></svg>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Password_fatigue "Read about password fatigue on Wikipedia").

<%= name %> is a centralized authentication service with both the commitment and potential to be the solution we all want. One password for everything. Secure and with respect for you and your privacy.

The commitment comes from a personal frustration and embarrassment with the [the current state of authentication](<%= about_current_state_of_authentication_path %>). We can do better!

The potential comes from 1) a unique [approach to identity and privacy](<%= about_approach_to_identity_path %> "Read about the") and 2) the fact that there are [no commercial interests](<%= about_non_profit_path %>) involved.

This sets <%= name %> apart from Google, Facebook, Twitter and all other providers of authentication services. <%= name %> is free to be a service for you. The human being using digital devices. And just that.

If you think this sounds like something you would like to have in our world, please send me an [email](mailto:anders@promiseauthentication.org "anders@promiseauthentication.org") where you tell me a bit about yourself and why you want it.

If you want to read more, please do so. Here you can read about the [security](), [implementation](), [financing](), [how to integrate]().
