I promise, you'll want to hear this about authentication.

Embrace the single point of failure and make that as secure, accessible and user friendly as possible.

I know, I know &mdash; you'd rather not.
I understand.
I forget my passwords all the time too.
But authentication is unavoidable.

When signing up to a new digital service, you currently have two choices:

Make up a new password ___or___ sign up using Facebook, Google or the like. That is: Use the same password you use everywhere, even though you know you shouldn't and feel guilty about it ___or___ share your personal data between more or less trustworthy organisations.

What an awful way to start a new relationship.

When revisiting a digital service on a new device, you need to recall how you signed up in the first place to succesfully login. You can't. Cross your fingers and click "Forgot my password".

What an awful way to resume a relationship.

We can do better.

<%= name %> is here to show you how.

<%= name %> is an attempt to solve the underlying challenge. Not just treating the symptoms.

There is a middleground, where you can have one password, and still share no personal data between the digital services you use.


They all ask us to come up with new passwords. We won't though &mdash; even though we know we should. We feel guilty. Stupid.
What an awful way to start a new relationship.

We can do better!


#{name} provides authentication as a service. Only that. No sharing of personal data. Just authentication.


It will provide digital services with authentication as a service, and provide us all with an opportunity to stop the madness of having to make up countless passwords that we have no change of remembering.

Many attempts has been made. Google. Facebook. Apple. Microsoft. They all want to provide authentication. But they _also_ share your personal data.

#{name} will _only_ provide authentication. None of your personal data will be shared with anyone.

The thing is, that authentication is a necessary evil. We need a way to verify that a claim is true. That you are who you claim you are.

Here is my proposal for a new way of thinking about authentication. This leads to a proposal for a centralized service to handle authentication for all digital services.

Authentication is a foundation for our digital presence.



But what if I said, that there is an alternative? A world where you would only have one password, and with that, automagically be signed in to all the digital services you use.

A world free from password managers and yellow notes with handwritten secrets on them.

A world where you do not feel helpless everytime you are presented with a login form.

We can create that world togehter. But it's not easy. It requires all of us to pull together. In the same direction.


There are two problems at the core of the current landscape of SSO

The first problem is commercial interest.

The second problem is mixing personal identity with the identity required in authentication. They are not the same. And should be treated differently.


But isn't this solved already with Google, Facebook, Twitter and all the others? Well, no. And let me explain why. The problem with the current SSO solutions out there, is that they all have at least one of the following problems within.


But what about security? 

And how do you feel when you forget one of those passwords? Or even worse, when you forget if you signed up to a specific service using Google, Facebook or Twitter?



Wouldn't it be nice if signing in to digital services wasn't such a hassle? No more "Forgot you password?".

What if I told you, that technically you only need one password. That you have so many passwords because we, the people that develops software, haven't managed to coordinate our efforts to handle authentication. Yet.

The reasons for this are many, and <%= name %> is yet another attempt at solving this. But the approach is very different and addresses all the challenges with the current state.

So we ask you to come up with new passwords every time you want to use our services the first time.

Sometimes, though, we offer you to sign up using one of your social accounts. Google, Facebook, Twitter or what have you.
