# Hi, I'm Anders üëã

I'm the human being behind <%= name %>. So who am I, and what makes me tick?

My two driving motivators for building <%= name %> is curiousity and embarrasment. Let's start with the ugly part.

## I'm sorry about this.

I literally get a physical response when I witness someone being faced with a login screen.

I know how much I hate the ambiguity when having to cope with one. I would say that I understand authentication flows better than most. So I can only start to imagine how people, who doesn‚Äôt think about authentication as part of their job, feel. They must feel awful.

So I get embarrassed. Embarrassed that we, the programmers building stuff for the internet, haven‚Äôt found an elegant solution to a common problem. Authentication. 

We‚Äôve collectively decided that having human beings create hundreds of password is a good idea. Or, that having human beings sell their data and attention to big companies with indeterminate commercial interests is a good idea.

It‚Äôs not!

All that attention and energy could be spent way better! I wonder how much time people spend in ‚ÄúForgot password‚Äù-flows.

Did you know that the small part of the brain called amygdala get‚Äôs activated when people face ambiguity? And did you know, that increased activity in amygdala can lead to feeling anxiety, fear and anger?

What do you think happens in people‚Äôs brain when presented with an average sign in form? (I haven‚Äôt found research on this yet, so it‚Äôs an actual question.)

My guess is _not_ that they feel happy and invigorated. My guess is they feel anger, fear and anxiety. My guess is that their amygdala overheat from the ambiguity.

What an awful way to start a relationship.

## We can do better.

So I set out to see if there could be a way we could solve this, without _that_ solution being a problem itself.

A way to reduce the number of times a human being is presented with a sign in form. And when they see one, they don't feel anger, fear or anxiety.

A way to build trust between humans and technology from their first encounter.

## While protecting each other.

Being a centralized solution, it would have to be a solution that would work even for people whose life depends on privacy. This might sound hollow coming from someone whose life does _not_ depend on privacy, but that doesn't change the reality for those who live with the risk.

I wanted to see, if it would be possible to implement authentication completely decoupled from and void of personal identity.

As of May 2020, I believe it is.
