# Security

One password for everything. Is that a good idea?

The thing is, that it's not that different from the current state of authentication.

The security in <%= name %> will be provided by open standards for encryption and authentication.

All data on the servers will be either hashed or encrypted, such that a breach of the database would not expose any information about you.

Information shared with relying parties will be protected by the JWT standard. In that way, relying parties can be sure that a users information is in fact authenticated by <%= name %>.
