# Current state of authentication

When signing up to a new service you usually have two options. Either create a new password or log in using one of the giants (Google, Facebook et. al.).

That is, _either_ use that same password you always use or make one up you know you'll forget in a minute. Either way you feel bad because you know you should get this right and this is important.

_Or_, give more data to a giant and provide personal data to a third party that might, or might not, handle that data responsibly.

What an awfull way to start a new relationship.

When signing up to a new digital service, you currently have two choices:

Make up a new password ___or___ sign up using Facebook, Google or the like. That is: Use the same password you use everywhere, even though you know you shouldn't and feel guilty about it ___or___ share your personal data between more or less trustworthy organisations.

What an awful way to start a new relationship.

When revisiting a digital service on a new device, you need to recall how you signed up in the first place to succesfully login. You can't. Cross your fingers and click "Forgot my password".

What an awful way to resume a relationship.

We can do better.
